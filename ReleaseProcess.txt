Release Process:
-----------------
For now we will consider releasing every 2 weeks or as incements made. 
Can release more often when this process is automated. For now it's mostly manual.
Our Process looks like:

1. Repo branched onto local machine
2. changes commited/merged back to testing branch as often as possible
3. tests run on testing branch and report results
4. staging environment (lotusprogramming.com/s) is backed up
5. only parts of site needed are replaced
6. End to End Tests run on staging environment
7. Main site backed up with unique version and date
8. Only parts needed changed on production
